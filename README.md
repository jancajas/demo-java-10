# Java 10 Feature Demo

Demonstrates the features that will be available in Java 10.
The links below take you to the demo in this project, the JEP responsible for introducing the feature, and to other sources if available.

Putting everything here will take a while, so you have to be patient.
If you can't, check out the [JDK 10 page](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/) and look through the JEPs.
You can read more from me on [codefx.org](http://codefx.org) and follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nipafx)
